    Improving Commit Comments

    Updated information files

    The README has been updated to describe the current state of the repository.

    Repository owner information added to README.md

Why branches are used: By using branches early and often, it is easy to track which series of commits was related to a certain feature. Plus, in corporate/large team settings, this allows the main branch to implement enforcement of pull requests without requiring such a request for a developer to progress a branch.

Difference between git commands: git status showcases the status of the branch you are in, including which commits are staged/unstaged, and whether or not your local branch is up-to-date with the remote branch. Meanwhile, git log showcases information about individual commits, including when they were made and what the commit messages were.

Which commands would: git log --follow Vehicle.h
git log --grep="file"

OOP: Inheritance allows a class to inherit the properties and methods of a parent or base class. Polymorphism allows a variable, object, or function to take on multiple forms. Encapsulation involves bundling related data and the methods used to work with that data into one unit.

Workflow differences: In the Dictator and Liutenants workflow, each change goes through multiple stages of approval before ultimately being pushed by one Dictator. This is a more limited version of the Integration Workflow, where multiple people can push changes. Furthermore, the blessed repository is the only repo in Dictator and Lieutenants workflow; meanwhile, each developer has their own public and private repo in Integration.

Large Team Benefits: With the Dictator and Lieutenants workflow, the Dictator can keep version conflicts to a minimum. By enforcing all of the pushes, the blessed repository remains consistent, making it easy for a developer to add their changes without accidentally making another developer's changes outdated.
